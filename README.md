These jupyter notebooks were used for the research of the paper

> [1] Benjamin Jahn, Lars Watermann, Johann Reger: *On the design of stable periodic orbits of a triple pendulum on a cart with experimental validation* (<https://doi.org/10.1016/j.automatica.2020.109403>)

It shows the design and implementation of a periodic orbit maneuver of a triple pendulum on a cart by means of inversion-based feedforward control design for finite-time transitions. Originally, all calculations have been done using a well known commercial numerical computing environment in the past. The main goal of these notebooks is to translate all involved steps to python and its amazing libraries (numpy, sympy, scipy, plotly, ...).
